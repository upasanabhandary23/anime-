Q6. Write an if condition to check that age is between 14 and 90 inclusively.
“Inclusively” means that age can reach the edges 14 or 90
if (age >= 14 && age <= 90)

Q7. Write an if condition to check that age is NOT between 14 and 90 inclusively.
Create two variants: the first one using NOT !, the second one – without it.
i) if (!(age >= 14 && age <= 90))
ii) if (age < 14 || age > 90)

Q8. Which of these alerts are going to execute?
What will the results of the expressions be inside if(...)?
i) if (-1 || 0) alert( 'first' );
ii) if (-1 && 0) alert( 'second' );
iii) if (null || -1 && 1) alert( 'third' );
 the first and the third will execute.

 Q9. Write the code which asks for a login with prompt.
If the visitor enters "Admin", then prompt for a password, if the input is an empty line or Esc – show “Canceled”, if it’s another string – then show “I don’t know you”.
The password is checked as follows:
If it equals “TheMaster”, then show “Welcome!”,
Another string – show “Wrong password”,
For an empty string or cancelled input, show “Canceled”
The schema:
Please use nested if blocks. Mind the overall readability of the code.
Sol:
let userName = prompt("Who's there?", '');

if (userName === 'Admin') {

  let pass = prompt('Password?', '');

  if (pass === 'TheMaster') {
    alert( 'Welcome!' );
  } else if (pass === '' || pass === null) {
    alert( 'Canceled' );
  } else {
    alert( 'Wrong password' );
  }

} else if (userName === '' || userName === null) {
  alert( 'Canceled' );
} else {
  alert( "I don't know you" );
}
